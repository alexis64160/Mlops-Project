Summary

The human respiratory coronavirus OC43 was grown on a human rectal tumor
cell line and was isotopically labeled with amino acids, glucosamine. and orthophos-
phate to analyze virion structural proteins. Four major protein species were resolved
by electrophoresis and many of their properties were deduced from digestion studies
using proteolytic enzymes. The four proteins are: (1) A 190 kDa protein, the
presumed peplomeric protein. that was glycosylated and proteolytically cleavable by
trypsin into subunits of 110 and 90 kDa. The subunits each represent a different
amino acid sequence on the basis of peptide mapping: (2) a 130 kDa protein that
was glycosylated and behaved as a disulfide-linked dimer of 65 kDa molecules. It is
the apparent virion hemagglutinin on the basis of digestion studies with trypsin,
bromelain and pronase; (3) a 55 kDa nucleocapsid protein that was phosphorylated:
(4) a 26 kDa matrix protein that was glycosylated. The 190, 130. 55 and 26 kDa
species can therefore be designated P. H. N and M, respectively. They exist in molar
ratios of 4: 1:33:33, and are calculated to be present at the rate of 88, 22, 726, and
726 molecules per virion, respectively.

human respiratory coronovirus OC43, structural proteins

Introduction

Coronaviruses are estimated to cause approximately 20% of upper respiratory
disease in humans (Larsen et al., 1980; McIntosh et al., 1970). Human respiratory
coronaviruses are found us either one of two antigenic types: those related to human
coronavirus OC43 (viruses that could originally be grown only in tracheal organ
culture), and those related to human coronavirus 229E (viruses that could be
